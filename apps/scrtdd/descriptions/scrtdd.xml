                        to release memory (e.g. catalog waveform data) after a period of inactivity at the cost of

                            These options control the creation of double-difference observations
                            without cross-correlation and are used only in real-time single event
                            relocation but NOT in multi-event relocation (--reloc-catalog 
                            command line option).
                            The real-time relocation works in two steps: the first one refines the
                            initial location creating double-difference observations from absolute
                            travel time differences and solving the system. The first step is
                            controlled by this option group.
                            Next, the second step is performed. Starting from the refined location
                            and solving again a double-difference system but this time using both
                            absolute travel times difference and cross-correlation differential
                            travel times observations. The second step is controlled by the
                            'doubleDifferenceObservations' option group.

                                within pairs, to be used to create double-difference observations.
                                Within an event pair, an observation is created for every station
                                for which exist phases for both events.
                                To build the event pairs a clustering algorithm is used, joining
                                together events within a given distance and fulfilling specific
                                requirements which are configurable in here.

                                    This option define how neighbouring events are selected.
                                    From Waldhauser 2009: "to assure a spatially homogeneous subsampling, reference
                                    events are selected within each of five concentric, vertically elongated
                                    ellipsoidal layers of increasing thickness.
                                    The dimension of the ellipsoid is based on the assumed error in the routine
                                    locations and the maximum interevent distance over which model errors can still
                                    be effectively minimized (see Waldhauser, 2001).
                                    The layers are twice as thick at the poles than they are at the equator to 
                                    accommodate the generally larger error in the depth of the routine location of
                                    a new event. Each layer is split up into its eight quadrants (or cells), and 
                                    the  neighboring events are selected from each of the 40 cells."
                                    SCRTDD selects neighbours for each ellipsoid/quadrant conbination in
                                    a round robin fashion until "maxNumNeigh" is reached. If there are no events
                                    in a specific ellipsoid/quadrant location it is simply skipped.

                            These options control the creation of double-difference observations
                            with cross-correlation and are used both in real-time single event
                            relocation and in multi-event relocation (--reloc-catalog 
                            command line option).
                            The real-time relocation works in two steps: the first one refines the
                            initial location creating double-difference observations from absolute
                            travel time differences and solving the system. The first step is
                            controlled by 'doubleDifferenceObservationsNoXcorr' option group.
                            Next, the second step is performed. Starting from the refined location
                            and solving again a double-difference system, but this time using both
                            absolute travel times difference and cross-correlation differential
                            travel times observations. The second step is controlled by this
                            option group.
                            The multi-event relocation works in one step only and it uses this 
                            option group.

                                To build the event pairs a clustering algorithm is performed, joining

                                    From Waldhauser 2009: "to assure a spatially homogeneous subsampling, reference
                                    events are selected within each of five concentric, vertically elongated
                                    ellipsoidal layers of increasing thickness.
                                    The dimension of the ellipsoid is based on the assumed error in the routine
                                    locations and the maximum interevent distance over which model errors can still
                                    be effectively minimized (see Waldhauser, 2001).
                                    The layers are twice as thick at the poles than they are at the equator to 
                                    accommodate the generally larger error in the depth of the routine location of
                                    a new event. Each layer is split up into its eight quadrants (or cells), and 
                                    the  neighboring events are selected from each of the 40 cells."
                                    SCRTDD selects neighbours for each ellipsoid/quadrant conbination in
                                    a round robin fashion until "maxNumNeigh" is reached. If there are no events
                                    in a specific ellipsoid/quadrant location it is simply skipped.
                                    Note: if 'numEllipsoids' is 0 then the concentric ellipsoid algorithm will not
                                    be used and the events will be selected on nearest neighbor basis within a

                            Setting a value different than 0 enables the solver to use a damped
                            (regularized) least squares system.
                            The damping factor value constrains the changes in earthquakes
                            parameters (location and time) preventing them becoming very large,
                            and it also helps in case of ill-conditioned systems.
                            A too high value prevents the events from changing at all. A too low
                            value might result in a huge shift of the event cluster after
                            relocation, although the structure should persist.

                                        Similar to the --merge-catalogs option 
                                        but events keep their ids. If multiple 
                                        events share the same id, subsequent 
                                        events will be discarded.
